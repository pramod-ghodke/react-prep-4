      <h1>2. What is Context api</h1>
      <p>Ans-
  The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application. (or) Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
    For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components. 
  const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue)

    <h1>3. Difference between callback and useCallback Hook ?</h1>
    <p>Ans- <br>
      The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since setState() is asynchronous the callback function is used for any post action. Note: It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.
    </p>
    <pre> setState({ name: 'John' }, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'))</pre>

    <h1>4. What is Props Drilling Concept ?What is State Uplifting ?</h1>
    <h4>Prop Drilling-</h4>
    <p>It is the process by which you pass data from one component of the React Component tree to another by going through other components that do not need the data but only help in passing it around.</p>
    <h4>State Uplifting-</h4>
    <p>
      When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components.

    <h1>5. Difference between useEffect and useContext ?</h1>
    <h4>useEffect-</h4>
    <p>
      It allows us to implement all of the lifecycle hooks from within a single function API. // this will run when the component mounts and anytime the stateful data changes React.useEffect(() => { alert('Hey, Nads here!'); });

This will run, when the component is first initialized React.useEffect(() => { alert('Hey, Nads here!'); }, []); <br><br>

This will run only when count state changes React.useEffect(() => { fetch('nads').then(() => setLoaded(true)); }, [count]); <br> <br>

This will run when the component is destroyed or before the component is removed from UI. React.useEffect(() => { alert('Hey, Nads here'); return () => alert('Goodbye Component'); }); <br><br>
    </p>
    <h4>useContext-</h4>
    <p>
      This hook allows us to work with React's Context API, which itself a mechanism to allow us to share data within it's component tree without passing through props. It basically removes prop-drilling const ans = { right: '‚úÖ', wrong: 'üö´' }
    </p>
    <pre>
      const AnsContext = createContext(ans);

     function Exam(props) {
          return (
              // Any child component inside this component can access the value which is sent.
            <AnsContext.Provider value={ans.right}>
                  <RightAns />
              </AnsContext.Provider>
        
          
          )
      }  
    
      function RightAns() {
          // it consumes value from the nearest parent provider.
          const ans = React.useContext(AnsContext);
          return <p>{ans}</p>
          // previously we were required to wrap up inside the AnsContext.Consumer
          // but this useContext hook, get rids that.
      }

    <h1>6. What are React Life cycles Explain each one with Example</h1>
    <h4>Ther are four Phase in React Lifecycles- <br>
    1- Initialization <br>
    2- Mounting <br>
    3- Updating <br>
    4- Unmounting
    </h4>
    <p>
      Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class. <br><br>
      Mounting: Mounting is the phase of the component lifecycle when the initialization of the component is completed and the component is mounted on the DOM and rendered for the first time on the webpage. Now React follows a default procedure in the Naming Conventions of these predefined functions where the functions containing ‚ÄúWill‚Äù represents before some specific phase and ‚ÄúDid‚Äù represents after the completion of that phase.<br><br>
      componentWillMount() Function: As the name clearly suggests, this function is invoked right before the component is mounted on the DOM i.e. this function gets invoked once before the render() function is executed for the first time. <br>
      componentDidMount() Function: Similarly as the previous one this function is invoked right after the component is mounted on the DOM i.e. this function gets invoked once after the render() function is executed for the first time <br><br>
      Updating:Updation is the phase where the states and props of a component are updated followed by some user events such as clicking, pressing a key on the keyboard, etc.<br><br>
      Unmounting: As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page.
